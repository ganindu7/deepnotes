# Communicating with a target device
{: .no_toc }

For our projects we will need to communicate with target hardware in various ways. Here we wil discuss using shell and HDMI cable.

## 1. Using SSH
First we check if our target has a SSH server running, Usually you can SSH into a factory Jetson device and get started straight away. Here I've used ubuntu running on kernel `4.15.0-132-generic` ( you can check by typing  `uname -r` into the shell )

### Checking the host side 

If a server is not installed there won't be a `/etc/init.d/ssh` directory.

If ssh server installed you can test the status by `/etc/init.d/ssh status`

Note: If you don't have SSH working on the target you won't be able to tunnel into the device, therefore use the commendline `sudo apt install openssh-server` or use a package manager like synaptic.

### Connecting from the remote  

Before connecting we need to know the IP address, username and the password for the host. Also a quick word about my setup.
